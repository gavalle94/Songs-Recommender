# Songs-Recommender
Recommendation System written in Python, using the pySpark framework and other Data Science libraries

## Project overview
### What is the project for
The goal of this demo is to build a recommender system able to suggest song artists to users. Given the artists and the user behaviours datasets, the first step is to analyze them and clean the data (for example: several artist names could refer to the same person or band).

Then, the model is built. The idea is to find "similar" users, so that the system can suggest new artists according to these similarities. In other words: if user "A" likes artist "X", a similar user "B" could like "X" too.

### How to access the project files
You can find both the original Python Notebook code and an HTML file, that is more portable in terms of readability.
