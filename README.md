  <h1>Songs-Recommender</h1>
  Recommendation System written in Python, using the pySpark framework and other Data Science libraries

  <h2>Project overview</h2>
  <h3>What is the project for</h3>
  <p>The goal of this demo is to build a recommender system able to suggest song artists to users. Given the artists and the user behaviours datasets, the first step is to analyze them and clean the data (for example: several artist names could refer to the same person or band).</p>

  <p>Then, the model is built. The idea is to find "similar" users, so that the system can suggest new artists according to these similarities. In other words: if user "A" likes artist "X", a similar user "B" could like "X" too.</p>

  <h3>How to access the project files</h3>
  You can find both the original Python Notebook code and an HTML file, that is more portable in terms of readability.
